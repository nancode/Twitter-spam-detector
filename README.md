# Twitter-spam-detector

## Spam tweet detector using BayesNet
Spam tweet detector is a Bayesian Network that employs Bayesâ€™ theorem to determine whether a given tweet is a spam one using the observed features. The probability of the occurrence of the observable variables flow through the system in the direction of causality and the counter causal direction to estimate the likelihood of a given tweet being a spam one.

The observed features are grouped into 3 parts to ensure the sparse structure and hence space variables including Account Features Suggestion, Tweet Feature Suggestion and Graph Feature Suggestion are used. Later these variables are used to decide on the likelihood of the tweet being a spam. The characteristics of a spam tweet are then manifested.
